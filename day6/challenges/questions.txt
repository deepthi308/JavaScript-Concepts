// Question 1:

/*
Given an array of forcasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with these temperatures.

Example: [17, 21, 23] will print '17Â°C in 1 days ... 21C in 2 days ...23C in 3 days ...'

Create a function 'printForcast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a string like the above to the console.

Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems!

Test Data 1: [17, 21, 23]
Test Data 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
