// Question 1:

/*
Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is  20%.

1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill values as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (You can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill valuevof 100.
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below.
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before.
4. BONUS: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip.

TEST DATA: 125, 555 and 44.

// Question 2:

/*
`Jonas has three friends, and his first best friend is called Michael` using object.
*/

// Question 3:

/*
Create a method inside the object called getSummary. This method should return a summary about the particular objects based on the properties that already exist within the object.
*/

// Question 4:

/*
Let's go back to Mark and john comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass/height**2 = mass/(height*height).(mass in kg and height in meter).

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height(Mark Miller and John Smith).
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects).
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI.
Example: 'John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!'

Test Data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69m tall.
John weights 92kg and is 1.95m tall.
