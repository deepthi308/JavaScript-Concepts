// Question 2:
/*
Use the BMI example from challenge #1, and the code you already wrote and improve it.

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "Jhon's BMI is higher than Mark's!

2. Use a template string to include the BMI values is the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI(28.3) is higher than john's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰.

Good Luck Myself ðŸ¤—

Thank you for using this application. See you next time.`);
