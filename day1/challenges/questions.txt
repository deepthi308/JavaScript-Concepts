// Question 1:
/*
Mark and john are trying to  compare their BMI, which is calculated using the formula:BMI=mass/height**2=mass/(height*height). mass in kg and height in meter.
*/

// Store mark's and johns mass and height in variables
// Calculate the BMI's using using the formula given
// Create a boolean variable "markHigherBMI" containing the information about whther mark has heigher BMI than john

// Test Data 1: Mark weight is 78kg and he is 1.69m tall.
// john weights 92kg and is 1.95m tall.
// Test Data 2: Mark weights 95kg and he is 1.88m tall.
// john weights 85kg and 1.76m tall.

//------------------------------------------------------

// Question 2:
/*
Use the BMI example from challenge #1, and the code you already wrote and improve it.

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "Jhon's BMI is higher than Mark's!

2. Use a template string to include the BMI values is the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI(28.3) is higher than john's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰.

Good Luck Myself ðŸ¤—
