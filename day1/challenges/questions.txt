// Question 1:
/*
Mark and john are trying to  compare their BMI, which is calculated using the formula:BMI=mass/height**2=mass/(height*height). mass in kg and height in meter.
*/

// Store mark's and johns mass and height in variables
// Calculate the BMI's using using the formula given
// Create a boolean variable "markHigherBMI" containing the information about whther mark has heigher BMI than john

// Test Data 1: Mark weight is 78kg and he is 1.69m tall.
// john weights 92kg and is 1.95m tall.
// Test Data 2: Mark weights 95kg and he is 1.88m tall.
// john weights 85kg and 1.76m tall.

//------------------------------------------------------

// Question 2:
/*
Use the BMI example from challenge #1, and the code you already wrote and improve it.

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "Jhon's BMI is higher than Mark's!

2. Use a template string to include the BMI values is the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI(28.3) is higher than john's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰.

Good Luck Myself ðŸ¤—

// Question 3:

/*
There are two gynastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas.
They compete against eachother 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below.
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and at the same time a score of atleast 100 points.
HINT: Use logical operator to test for minimun score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜Š

4.BONUS 2:
Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both the teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA:
Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110.
