// We know that string is a primitive datatype in javascript.
/*
So, you might think how string have access to this much properties and method

That is because javascript is smart enough to convert these string to an object with the same content inside it behind the scenes. So, its on  that object these methods are called

This process is called boxing. Because it  takes in a string which primitive and put it inside a box called object

Once the operations are performed on the string this string is converted back to the string
